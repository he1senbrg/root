# Attendance System

Track daily member attendance and generate monthly attendance summaries. The summaries are used for quick access to see how many days a member has attended in a specific month, used in the amD attendance report.

## Models

### Attendance
```rust
struct Attendance {
    attendance_id: i32,
    member_id: i32,
    date: NaiveDate,
    is_present: bool,
    time_in: Option<NaiveTime>,
    time_out: Option<NaiveTime>,
    created_at: NaiveDateTime,
    updated_at: NaiveDateTime,
}
```
The final two fields are not exposed in the interface for obvious reasons.

### AttendanceSummary
Monthly attendance summary for each member.
```rust
struct AttendanceSummary {
    member_id: i32,
    year: i32,
    month: i32,
    days_attended: i32,
}
```

### Daily Count
Total Lab count for each date
```rust
pub struct DailyCount {
    pub date: String,
    pub count: i64,
}
```

### Member Summary
Total lab members attended in the past 6 months
```rust
pub struct MemberAttendanceSummary {
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    pub present_days: i64,
}
```

### Attendance Report
Attendance report of the club members
```rust
pub struct AttendanceReport {
    pub daily_count: Vec<DailyCount>,
    pub member_attendance: Vec<MemberAttendanceSummary>,
    pub max_days: i64,
}
```
